For music lovers, sheet music in Roam Research is finally available!

Create your own music using [abc notation](https://abcnotation.com/wiki/abc:standard) or paste and render sheet music for music you find on the internet.

There are two options available at present:
1. Paste music in the abc notation directly into your graph using the command palette option 'Paste sheet music in ABC notation'
2. Create music in abc notation within your graph. Start with a blank template by using the command palette option 'Create sheet music in ABC notation'

You can find examples of music in abc notation at:
- https://abcnotation.com/examples
- https://thesession.org/
- https://www.montrealsession.ca/index.html

Changes made in the abc notation child block will automatically render to the sheet music, as shown below. Now you can write music in Roam Research.

Standard abc notation applies - you can find a key to the notation at [abc notation](https://abcnotation.com/wiki/abc:standard).

**Notes:**
- In this first iteration, only one piece of music can be rendered on a page. I am working on a fix to allow multiple pieces to render correctly.
- I am aware of an issue with overflow of the rendered sheet music on page resize, and am working on a fix.
